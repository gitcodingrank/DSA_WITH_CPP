/*
Time-Space TradeOff - You try to balance both time and space while designing the optimised algorithm.

Problem: You need to find the number effienciently.
let number is 6

Option 1:
size of below array(n): 7 
int [] arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
There is no extra space, we have used there for taking time.

for loop: visiting the each and every element: worst case: n time loop will run.

Option 2:
int [] arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
map<int, int> numbers;
Loop: stores give array numbers in form of key-value pair.
{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 3, 4:4, 5:5, 6:6, 7:7};

Let access 1: numbers[1]; //Constant Time
